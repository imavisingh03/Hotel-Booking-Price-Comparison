## About

The **Hotel Price Analysis** tool is designed to fetch hotel details for a given destination and display them in a structured format, enabling easy comparison of hotel prices, ratings, and proximity to the chosen location. The goal is to enhance the userâ€™s ability to choose the best hotel based on their preferences.

The tool scrapes data using `BeautifulSoup` and organizes it into a `pandas` dataframe, which can then be visualized using `matplotlib` charts.

## Setup

To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have Python installed, then run the following command to install the required libraries:

    ```bash
    pip install -r install_requires.txt
    ```

   The required libraries include:
   - `requests`
   - `beautifulsoup4`
   - `pandas`
   - `numpy`
   - `matplotlib`

2. **Run the Application**: After installing the dependencies, execute the main program:

    ```bash
    Price_Analysis.py
    ```

## Usage

Once the program is running, follow these steps to perform a hotel price analysis:

1. **Input Destination and Dates**:
    - You will be prompted to enter the following:
      - **Destination** (e.g., "Mumbai")
      - **Check-in date** (e.g., "2024-10-10")
      - **Check-out date** (e.g., "2024-10-15")

2. **Data Extraction**:
    - The tool will scrape hotel details for your destination and create a dataframe with the following columns:
      - Hotel names
      - Prices
      - Ratings
      - Distances from the destination

3. **Data Visualization**:
    - After extracting the data, the tool generates visualizations for easy analysis. The charts show prices, ratings, and distances from the destination center.

## Visualization Guide

The tool provides the following visualizations based on the extracted data:

1. **Price and Ratings Chart**:
    - **Blue bars** represent hotel prices.
    - **Green line** represents hotel ratings.

2. **Distance Chart**:
    - **Blue bars** represent the distances of hotels from the destination center.

These visualizations provide a clear comparison between hotel prices, ratings, and distances, helping users make informed decisions.

## Improvements & Future Work

1. **Distance Improvements**:  
   The current distance data relies on proximity to the destination center. Future updates will include more refined location-based sorting and filtering, such as considering nearby landmarks.

2. **Additional Filters**:  
   Future versions could include the option to filter hotels based on price range, user ratings, or hotel amenities.
